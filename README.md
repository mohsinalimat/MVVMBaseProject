As is common in every app development cycle, there comes a time when we must start setting up a project. And this is pretty much always the same steps. Setting up folders, architecture, Podfile, etc.

This is a base project in **Swift**, for **iOS** application. This base project is based on the **MVVM** architeture. It's totally automated thanks to a script, for fast production.

#Installation

To install this base project, for your new app, just run the script *install.sh*. This will rename the base project with your app name, and install pods. After that, you will be ready to go.

```sh
./install.sh YOUR_APP_NAME
```
